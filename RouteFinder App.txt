1. Feature List: figure out what your app is supposed to do at a high level

2. Use Case Diagrams: Nail down the big processes that your app performs, and any extrnal forces that are involved.

3. Break Up the Problem: Break your application up into modules of functionality, and then decide on an order in which to tackle each of your modules

4. Requirements: Figure out the individual requirements for each module, and make sure those fit in with the big picture

5. Domain Analysis: Figure out how your use cases ,ap to objects in your app, and make sure your customer is on the same page as you are

6. Prelimnary Design: Fill in detail about your object, define relationships between the objects, and apple principles and patterms

7. Implementation: Write code, test it, and make it works. Do this for each behavior, each feature, each use case, each problem, until you're done

8. Delivery: You're done ! release your software, submit your invoices, and get paid.

Objectville RouteFinder 
=======================

<--===============================================================-->

A. Feature List:

1. We have to be able to represent a subway line and the stations along that line. 

2. We must be albe to load multiple subway lines into the program, including overlapping lines

3. We need to be able to figure out a valid path between any two stattions on any lines

4. We need to be able to print out a route between two stations as a set of directions.

<--===============================================================-->\

B. Use case.

1. The administrator supplies a file of stations and lines

2. The system read in the name of a stations

3. The system validates that the station doesn't already exist

4. The system adds the new station to the subway

5. The system repeats steps 2-3 until all station are added

6. The system reads in the name of a line to added

7. The system reads in two stations that are connected

8.The system validates that the station exist

9. The system creates a new connection between the two station, going in both directions on the current line

10. The system repeats steps 7-9 until the line is complete

11. The system repeats steps 6-10 until all lines are entered
