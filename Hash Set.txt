In HashSet you won't be able to find value by index. 
If you still want to find the element you have no other option but to use the iterator, 
it will iterate through the Hashset and give you one by one element from the Hashset.

You want to find your element by index you should use ArrayList.

There are two ways of iterating the HashSet -

HashSet <String> newset = new HashSet <String>();

 // populate hash set
      newset.add("A"); 
      newset.add("BB");
      newset.add("CCC");  

      // create an iterator
      Iterator iterator = newset.iterator(); 

      // check values
      while (iterator.hasNext()){
         System.out.println("Value: "+iterator.next() + " ");  
      }
Second approach is by using for loop-

for (String s : newset ) {
    System.out.println("Value: " +s);
}
